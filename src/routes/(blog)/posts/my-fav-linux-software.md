This is a list of GUI-Software that I need to have installed on all my (Arch-)Linux workstations.

This is not a complete list of all the software I use on a daily basis
(like Git, Neovim, ranger, Tmux, ..),
but it's a quick mock-up of what I tend to use somewhat regularly
when it comes to GUI-Software.
