I worked like 5 years at Ströer,
and I must say that it was a great time.

I learned a lot, met a lot of great people, and had a lot of fun.

But they recently closed offices in Frankfurt and Cologne for the unit I was working for
and moved everything to Berlin.

We had different options to choose from:

1. Apply for a job at a new unit in Berlin
2. Get a severance package
3. Get a smaller severance package and start at a so called "Transfergesellschaft"

I decided to choose option 3 and started looking for new jobs.

I had some interviews and got some offers,
but in the end Frank Kanzler wrote me on LinkedIn and
asked if I would be interested in a job at TBInt.

I was baffled, because I knew Frank from my time at Ströer,
but always was under the impression that he did not really like me.

So I was surprised that he asked me if I would be interested in a job at TBInt.

I wrote him exactly that and he said that this is bollocks and that he always liked me.
We had a good chat via phone and I decided to drive to Ober-Ramstadt to meet him and the team.

I must say that I was impressed by the team, their vision and the work they are doing at TBInt.

So I decided to take the job and start at TBInt.
