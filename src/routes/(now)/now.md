Here is a list of things I am currently working on or learning.

## i3 + Polybar + Rofi

In my continous quest to find the perfect desktop setup,
when it comes to productivity and aesthetics, I'm yet again back to i3wm.
I am currently working on a new setup with i3, Polybar and Rofi.

Back in the days I used i3wm with dmenu and a custom statusbar and
was quite happy with it, but then I switched to regualar Gnome, MacOS and now Pop!\_OS.

I am quite happy with Pop!\_OS, its launcher, it's speed and simplicity,
but I'm always eager to improve and I see a lot of potential in going back i3wm.

Follow my journey with i3wm on my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/gorillamoe/dotfiles).

## Wishlist

I migrated my [wishlist](/wishlist) to a simple markdown file.

## Tracking time

My wife needed a time tracking tool for her work.

The requirements were simple:

- Track time ‚è∞ for different projects
- Offline üôà first citizen
- No bullshit üí© like ads or tracking or login requirements or subscription fees
- Export the data as PDF
- Ideally it should work well with Linux üêß, Mac and Windows

I didn't research much, but I didn't find anything that fits the bill.

So I decided to build a simple time tracking tool myself.
It started off as a simple TUI app in Go,
but I quickly realized that I my wife would prefer a GUI.

So I started building a simple Electron app.
Then I migrated everything from Electron and plain JS
to React, TypeScript and Vite including a CI/CD pipeline.

Welcome to [timetrack ‚è∞](https://timetrack.mistweaver.co).

## Move to Pop!\_OS

I recently moved from [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org) (10y+)
to MacOS (because work-related stuff) and now I settled with ‚ù§Ô∏è
[Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/).

## Fresh start

I cleaned up my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/gorillamoe/dotfiles).

## What are you using?

I created a [uses page](/uses) to list the tools and software I use.

## Powered by SvelteKit

I have migrated [this site](/) to SvelteKit.

The site is now statically generated and hosted on a cheap Hetzner cloud instance.
The deployment is automated with GitHub Actions.

## Learning SvelteKit

I am currently learning SvelteKit,
a framework for building web applications with Svelte.
I am excited to see how it compares to other frameworks like React and Vue.
