Here is a list of things I am currently working on or learning.

## Fresh start

I cleaned up my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/gorillamoe/dotfiles).

I recently moved from [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org) (10y+)
to MacOS (because work-related stuff) and now I settled with ❤️
[Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/).

## What are you using?

I created a [uses page](/uses) to list the tools and software I use.

## Powered by SvelteKit

I have migrated [this site](/) to SvelteKit.

The site is now statically generated and hosted on a cheap Hetzner cloud instance.
The deployment is automated with GitHub Actions.

## Learning SvelteKit

I am currently learning SvelteKit,
a framework for building web applications with Svelte.
I am excited to see how it compares to other frameworks like React and Vue.
