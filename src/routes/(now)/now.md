Here is a list of things I am currently working on or learning.

## What are you using?

I created a [uses page](/uses) to list the tools and software I use.

## Powered by SvelteKit

I have migrated [this site](/) to SvelteKit.

The site is now statically generated and hosted on a cheap Hetzner cloud instance.
The deployment is automated with GitHub Actions.

## Learning SvelteKit

I am currently learning SvelteKit,
a framework for building web applications with Svelte.
I am excited to see how it compares to other frameworks like React and Vue.
