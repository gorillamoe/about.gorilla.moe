This is the source code for [gorilla.moe](https://gorilla.moe),
a personal website that I use to showcase my projects and share a little bit about myself.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
